# Hangman Game

The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. The objective of the game is for the player to guess the letters in a hidden word before running out of attempts. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and randomization.

## Features

1. Randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words (fruit names).
2. Provides feedback on each guessed letter, showing correct guesses and the number of remaining attempts.
3. Allows the player to win by guessing all letters correctly or lose by running out of attempts.
4. User-friendly interface with clear instructions and feedback.

## Requirements

This project uses Pythonâ€™s standard library, so no additional dependencies are required.
Program: Tested on Python 3.12.3

## Instructions to Run (in the terminal)

1. `cd Hangman Game Code`
2. `python hangman_game.py`
3. Follow the on-screen instructions:
    - The game will randomly select a word and display underscores representing 
      unguessed letters.
    - Guess one letter at a time.
    - If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
    - If the letter is incorrect, you will lose one attempt.
    - The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.
